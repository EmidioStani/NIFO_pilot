Planning permits are issued by Planning Authorities and building permits are issued by Building Authorities. The Municipalities of Nicosia, Limassol, Paphos and Larnaca and the regional Officers of the Town Planning Department are Planning Authorities. All Municipalities as well as all District Officers are Building Authorities. For developments in communities, a planning application is submitted to the Planning Authority (regional Officers of the Town Planning Department) and once it is approved, a building application is submitted to the Building Authority (the District Officer). Similarly, for developments within municipal limits, a planning application is submitted to the Planning Authority (the regional Officer of the Town Planning Department or the Municipality itself) and once the planning permit is granted a building application is submitted to the Municipality.In December 2014, the responsible Department signed the relevant contract for the development of an integrated information system aiming at covering the IT needs and demands of the department, as well as managing the building permits from the district administration offices. The project duration is 52 months. The project does not cover Municipalities The integrated information system is expected to be a powerful tool for the upgrading of the services offered by the Department, with purpose that of improvement in the bureaucratic procedures as well as of the average response time to citizens’ requests, and therefore the better and more effective public service. The system is expected to be up and running within the first quarter 2019. "
