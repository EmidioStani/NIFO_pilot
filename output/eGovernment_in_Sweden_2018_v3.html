The Monarch has no political power.</p><p>Legislative power is held by a unicameral parliament (<a href="http://www.riksdagen.se/">Riksdagen</a>). The Parliament has 349 members elected for a four-year term on the basis of universal direct suffrage. 310 of the seats in the Parliament are allocated to the 29 constituencies and 39 are adjustment seats distributed at a national level in order to obtain a nationally proportional result. A party must gain 4% of the national vote, or 12% of a constituency vote to enter Parliament. Minority governments and coalitions are the norm.</p><p>Executive power is held by the <a href="http://www.sweden.gov.se/">Government</a>, headed by the <a href="http://www.government.se/government-of-sweden/prime-ministers-office/stefan-lofven/">Prime Minister</a> and responsible to the Riksdag. The Government determines its policies and sets its priorities.</p><p>In total, there are three levels of Public Administration in Sweden: approx. 400 Central Government agencies, 21 Regional Government authorities (county councils) and 290 Local Government authorities (municipalities). Regional and local authorities are independent of the Government. Furthermore, there are 21 county administrative boards in Sweden, one in each county. The work of a county administrative board is based on its role as Central Government representative in the region and coordinator for issues passed on to it by the Central Government.</p><p>The Constitution of Sweden consists of four <a href="https://www.riksdagen.se/en/How-the-Riksdag-works/Democracy/The-Constitution/">fundamental laws</a>: the Act of Succession (1810); the Freedom of the Press Act (1949); the Instrument of Government (1974); and the Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression (1991).</p><p>Sweden became a member of the European Union on 1 January 1995.</p><p><strong>Head of State:</strong> King <a href="http://www.royalcourt.se/royalcourt/theroyalfamily/hmkingcarlxvigustaf.4.396160511584257f218000644.html">Carl XVI Gustaf</a> (since 1973).</p><p><strong>Head of Government:</strong> Prime Minister <a href="http://www.government.se/government-of-sweden/prime-ministers-office/stefan-lofven/">Stefan Löfvén</a> (since 2 October 2014).</p><h1>Information Society Indicators</h1><h2>Generic Indicators</h2><p>The following graphs present data for the latest Generic Information Society Indicators for Sweden compared to the EU average.

The mission shall include a selection of investments by some twenty authorities. The purpose of the committee is to help government agencies and authorities to better carry out business development activities, as well as to enable faster change.</li><li>In August 2017 the Swedish government decided to give the Social Security Agency (Försäkringskassan) the task of offering and supporting secure and coordinated IT-operations within government administration. The mission aims at long-term raising IT security in Swedish authorities and will run until 2020, when the effort is to be evaluated and permanent forms determined.</li></ul><h2>eGovernment Legal Framework</h2><p>In December 2016 the Swedish government decided to give a special commissioner the task to investigate and analyse to what extent there is legislation that unnecessarily aggravates digital development and cooperation in the public sector. The results from the commission will be reported no later than March 2018.</p><h2>eGovernment Infrastructure </h2><p>In March 2017, the technical framework of the Swedish E-identification Board (E-legitimationsnämnden) was updated and adapted to eIDAS. Thanks to that, government authorities and municipalities will now be able to connect their eServices to the Swedish eIDAS node that is being developed by the Swedish E-identification Board.</p><h2>eGovernment Services </h2><ul><li>The <a href="http://bolagsverket.se/en">Swedish Companies Registration Office</a> has since 2016 been working on a government commission to make digital submission of companies’ annual report possible. The goal is to create a service that enables digital submission of annual reports in March 2018.</li><li>The <a href="https://skl.se/tjanster/englishpages.411.html">Swedish Association of Local Authorities and Regions</a> (SKL), together with municipalities, the <a href="http://www.government.se/government-agencies/swedish-agency-for-economic-and-regional-growth/">Swedish Agency for Economic and Regional Growth</a> and the <a href="http://bolagsverket.se/en">Swedish Companies Registration Office</a> launched the programme “<a id="_Hlk506297840"></a><a href="https://skl.se/naringslivarbetedigitalisering/digitalisering/naringslivehandel/enklareforetagandeverksamtse.6909.html">Serv</a><a href="https://skl.se/naringslivarbetedigitalisering/digitalisering/naringslivehandel/enklareforetagandeverksamtse.6909.html">e</a><a href="https://skl.se/naringslivarbetedigitalisering/digitalisering/naringslivehandel/enklareforetagandeverksamtse.6909.html">r</a><a href="https://skl.se/naringslivarbetedigitalisering/digitalisering/naringslivehandel/enklareforetagandeverksamtse.6909.html">at</a>”. The purpose of “Serverat” is to facilitate the life of entrepreneurs willing to open and run a business, while streamlining the work of the municipality. The programme was first launched, first for the restaurant sector, and then extended to the tourist industry. After a six-month pilot phase, in December 2017 Serverat has been launched in full mode in six municipalities. During the year 2018 it is expected to be launched in approximately 20 municipalities.</li></ul><h2>Other highlights</h2><ul><li>In March 2017 all municipalities in Sweden were offered to become partners of <a href="https://www.inera.se/om-inera/about-inera/">Inera Ltd</a>. Previously Inera was owned by the county councils and regions, focusing on eHealth issues. In the future the scope of Inera, which aims to facilitate the development of common digital solutions that help to streamline operations in municipalities, county councils and regions- is expected to be broadened to include domains such as schools and city buildings.</li><li>From autumn 2018 the use of the computer or other digital tools will be compulsory when students take tests in English, Swedish and Swedish as a second language in grade 9, upper secondary school and municipal adult education at upper secondary level.</li></ul><h2>2001-2017For previous news items, please consult the factsheets for past years, accessible through this <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/community/nifo/og_page/egovernment-factsheets">link</a>.</h2><table><tr><td><h1><a id="_Toc508094194"></a>eGovernment Strategy</h1></td></tr><tr><td><h2>Main strategic objectives and principles</h2></td></tr></table><p>A Sustainable Digitalised Sweden – A Digitalisation Strategy</p><p><img src="img/2-13.png" alt="standard_3" />In May 2017 the Swedish government presented the strategy “<a href="http://www.government.se/information-material/2017/06/fact-sheet-for-sustainable-digital-transformation-in-sweden--a-digital-strategy/">A Sustainable Digitalised Sweden - A Digitalisation Strategy</a>”. The strategy explains how the digitalisation policy will contribute to competitiveness, full employment and economically, socially and environmentally sustainable development in the society. The strategy sets the focus on government's digitalisation policy.</p><p>In order to achieve the overall objective of Sweden becoming a world leader in harnessing the opportunities of digital transformation, the strategy contains five goals: </p><ul><li>Enhancing the digital skills of the people, as to enable them to actively participate in the digital transformation;</li><li>Increase the digital security, and thus the trust and confidence of people in using digital services;</li><li>Fostering digital innovation by creating the competitive conditions for the development and spread of new or improved products and services of value to people and businesses;</li><li>Improving digital leadership, which entails better governance, but also measurement and follow-up activities;</li><li>Reinforcement of the digital infrastructure, as broadband infrastructure, which is crucial for transmitting data.</li></ul><h1>2017-2019 eHealth Action Plan</h1><p>In October 2017 the Swedish government and <a href="https://skl.se/tjanster/englishpages.411.html">Swedish Association of Local Authorities and Regions</a> (SKL) agreed on an <a href="http://www.regeringen.se/pressmeddelanden/2017/01/ny-samverkansorganisation-i-fokus-for-e-halsohandlingsplanen/">eHealth action plan for the period 2017-2019</a>. The action plan includes a new national cooperation and coordination structure.</p><p>The action plan is a concrete result of the <a href="https://skl.se/halsasjukvard/ehalsa/visionenehalsoarbetet.8859.html">2025 eHealth Care Vision</a>, developed by SKL and the Swedish government.</p><h1>Programme for the digital revival of the public sector: Digital First (2016 – 2018) </h1><p>The goal of the programme is to make Sweden the best in the world in the use of digitalisation opportunities. The work of the programme will be driven by several agencies that will be involved in monitoring and facilitating progress in different sectors of the economy. </p><p>The Swedish government sees digitalisation as the largest individual change factor that affects all parts of society. The objective of the ICT policy is clear – Sweden shall become the best in the world in using digitalisation opportunities. The main sub-targets of the government are: </p><ul><li>Achieving easier living for citizens; </li><li>More open public management that supports innovation and citizen participation; </li><li>Higher quality and efficiency in public management. </li></ul><p>The programme also implies that provision of digital services should be the first choice in the State’s relations with citizens and businesses, where relevant and possible. Digital First operates in three key priority areas: </p><ol><li>Digital Revival – control and digital maturity; </li><li>A smarter Sweden – innovative digital services; </li><li>A stable base – a national digital infrastructure.</li></ol><p>In December 2017 the Swedish government decided that a new central government authority for the digitalisation of the public sector will be launched on September 1, 2018. The mission of the new authority will be to develop, coordinate and support the digitalisation of central government authorities, municipalities and county councils. One important task will be to coordinate, develop, manage and provide a national digital infrastructure for the public sector. Tasks from several other central government agencies will be transferred to the new authority. The new government authority will be located in Sundsvall.</p><h1>Putting the citizen at the centre (2012 – present)</h1><p>The Swedish Government Strategy for Collaborative Digital Services in Government Administration, <a id="_Hlk506298740"></a><a href="http://www.regeringen.se/informationsmaterial/2015/04/med-medborgaren-i-centrum/">Putting the citizen a</a><a href="http://www.regeringen.se/informationsmaterial/2015/04/med-medborgaren-i-centrum/">t</a><a href="http://www.regeringen.se/informationsmaterial/2015/04/med-medborgaren-i-centrum/"> th</a><a href="http://www.regeringen.se/informationsmaterial/2015/04/med-medborgaren-i-centrum/">e</a><a href="http://www.regeringen.se/informationsmaterial/2015/04/med-medborgaren-i-centrum/"> centre</a>, was launched in December 2012. This strategy describes how the Swedish Government plans to further strengthen the ability of government agencies to work together in delivering digital services. More common digital services in the daily lives of both citizens and businesses will be further simplified. These digital services must be developed in a user-centric way:  simple and secure to use, and easily accessible to everyone. Innovation will be enhanced by making it easier to find and use re-usable public information and digital services with interfaces that can be used by other systems. The publication of public sector information on the Internet and the use of social media are to promote both transparency and citizen involvement. Quality and efficiency in government administration will be increased through standardised information management, better information security and digitised processes. Such internal efficiency and service in developing digital services must always be conditional to the protection of personal privacy and the need for confidentiality. The above objectives will form the basis of the Swedish Government’s coordination and prioritising of the development of inter-agency cross-sectorial projects.  </p><table><tr><td><h1><a id="_Toc508094195"></a>eGovernment Legal Framework</h1></td></tr><tr><td><h2>Main legal texts impacting on the development of eGovernment</h2></td></tr></table><h1><img src="img/2-14.jpeg" alt="keywords" />eGovernment Legislation</h1><p>eGovernment activities used to be regulated by general laws and ordinances on Public Administration. This Bill, which was passed by the Parliament on 2 July 2010, is not an eGovernment legislative document per se. However, it contains a long chapter specifically on eGovernment, while most initiatives concerning restructuring of public administration are related to electronic means. It describes, in fact, steps for working with eGovernment in the state administration. </p><p>In December 2016 the Swedish government decided to give a special commissioner the task to investigate and analyse to what extent there is legislation that unnecessarily aggravates digital development and cooperation in the public sector. The results from the commission will be reported no later than March 2018.</p><h1>Administrative Procedure Legislation</h1><p>In September 2017 the Swedish Parliament voted for a new <a href="https://www.riksdagen.se/sv/dokument-lagar/dokument/svensk-forfattningssamling/forvaltningslag-2017900_sfs-2017-900">Administrative Procedure Act (Förvaltningslag)</a>. The new law is according to many, significantly more technology independent than its previous equivalent and welcomes digital communication.</p><h1>Freedom of Information Legislation</h1><h5>Freedom of the Press Act (2011)</h5><p>In 1766, Sweden was the first country in the world to introduce legislation on Freedom of Information with the ‘Freedom of the Press Act’. This Act was reviewed in 1949 and was last amended on 1 January 2011. Chapter 2 on the Public Nature of Official Documents decrees that “every Swedish subject shall have <strong>free access </strong>to<strong> official documents</strong>”. Public authorities must respond immediately to requests for official documents. Requests can be in any form and anonymous. Each authority is required to keep a register of all official documents and most indices should be publicly available. There is currently an effort to make the registers available electronically. Decisions by public authorities to <strong>deny access</strong> to official documents may be appealed internally. Complaints can also be lodged to the <a href="http://www.jo.se/Page.aspx?Language=en">Parliamentary Ombudsman</a>, who can investigate and issue non-binding decisions.</p><h5><a href="http://www.regeringen.se/sb/d/11386/a/141034">Public Access to Information and Secrecy Act (2009:400)</a></h5><p>The Public Access to Information and Secrecy Act (2009:400) contains provisions on confidentiality and non-disclosure of public documents. Information can be given protection in various areas, among different agencies, or in various cases.</p><h3>Data Protection/Privacy Legislation</h3><h5>Adaptation to GDPR</h5><p>After the European Commission decided on a new regulation for data protection – the <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/FR/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679">General Data Protection Regulation</a> (GDPR), in February 2016 the Swedish government appointed a team to evaluate how Swedish laws and regulations should be adapted to GDPR, which will come into effect on 25 May, 2018.</p><p>On 12 May, 2017, the Swedish Data Protection Commission (Betänkande av Dataskyddsutredningen) published the <a href="http://www.riksdagen.se/sv/dokument-lagar/dokument/statens-offentliga-utredningar/sou-2017-39-_H5B339">evaluation</a> on the Swedish Parliament’s (Riksdag’s) website.</p><h5><a href="http://www.datainspektionen.se/in-english/legislation/The-Personal-Data-Act/">Personal Data Act (1998)</a></h5><p>The Personal Data Act came into force on 24 October 1998. The Personal Data Act was adopted to bring Swedish law into compliance with the requirements of the EU Data Protection Directive <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31995L0046:EN:HTML">95/46/EC</a>, which aims to prevent the violation of personal integrity in the processing of personal data. The Act lists certain <strong>fundamental requirements</strong> concerning the processing of personal data. These demands include, inter alia, that personal data may only be processed for specific, explicitly stated and justified purposes and if the person registered gives his/her consent. Exemptions to this rule include the exercise of official powers, or the fulfilment of a legal obligation by the controller of personal data. In many areas of the administration there are special registry laws to supplement or replace the provision in the Personal Data Act. The Act will be amended, in order to comply with the GDPR before 25 May 2018. </p><h1>eIdentification/eSignatures Legislation</h1><h5><a href="https://www.riksdagen.se/sv/dokument-lagar/dokument/svensk-forfattningssamling/lag-2013311-om-valfrihetssystem-i-fraga-om_sfs-2013-311">Law on Electoral Systems for Electronic Identification Services (2013)</a></h5><p>This Act contains provisions on the application of Electoral Systems for Electronic Identification Services.</p><h5><a href="http://www.notisum.se/rnp/SLS/LAG/20000832.HTM">Act on Qualified Electronic Signature (2001)</a></h5><p>This Act, which implements the EU Directive on a Community framework for electronic signatures (<a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31999L0093:EN:HTML">1999/93/EC</a>), entered into force on 1 January 2001. The Swedish electronic signature includes <strong>authentication</strong> and <strong>integrity</strong> requirements. According to the Act’s definition of qualified electronic signatures, there are only certain certification authorities (“CAs”) that may provide such signatures. The Act states that when a law or regulation contains requirements for a hand-written signature and if such signature is satisfied by electronic means, a qualified signature shall then fulfil this requirement.</p><h1>eCommerce Legislation</h1><h5><a href="http://www.notisum.se/rnp/SLS/LAG/20020562.HTM">Act on Electronic Commerce and other Information Society Services (2002)</a></h5><p>Adopted in 2002, this act transposed the EU Directive <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32000L0031:EN:HTML">2000/31/EC</a> on certain legal aspects of information society services, in particular electronic commerce (‘Directive on electronic commerce’).

This means that all providers to the public sector must send eInvoices and that authorities, municipalities, county councils and regions must be able to receive eInvoices.</p><h1>Re-use of Public Sector Information (PSI)</h1><h5><a href="http://www.notisum.se/rnp/sls/lag/20100566.htm">Law on the Re-use of Public Administration Documents (2010)</a></h5><p>On 1 July 2010, Sweden adopted new legislation transposing Directive <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32003L0098:En:HTML">2003/98/EC</a> on the re-use of Public Sector Information in the form of Law No. 2010:566 of 3 June 2010 on the re-use of public administration documents.

It is designed to provide documents and records, information about current government bills, initiatives and ministerial activities, and accounts of how the decision-making process works in Sweden.</p><p>The website has three main sections:</p><p>The Government and the Government Offices: The section offers up-to-date information listed according to each ministry, minister and subject area. </p><p>Publications: This section contains all information material and other publications issued in English or other foreign languages (along with an ordering facility). </p><p>How Sweden is governed: This section places the work of the Government and the Government Offices in context. Decision-making processes, the EU and other matters are described and exemplified.</p><h5>‘<a href="https://www.verksamt.se/">verksamt.se’</a> portal: the Swedish Business Link to Government</h5><p>The ‘<a href="https://www.verksamt.se/"><em>verksamt.se</em></a>’ portal provides a comprehensive<strong> single-point</strong> for entrepreneurs and enterprises to access relevant and official eServices and information from three public authorities: the <a href="http://www.bolagsverket.se/">Swedish Companies Registration Office</a> (Bolagsverket); the <a href="http://www.skatteverket.se/">Swedish Tax Agency</a> (Skatteverket); and the <a href="http://www.tillvaxtverket.se/">Swedish Agency for Economic and Regional Growth</a> (Tillväxtverket).</p><p>This initiative <strong>develops</strong>, <strong>improves</strong>, <strong>joins </strong>and<strong> replaces </strong>two existing eServices; the online guidance for those willing to start and/or run a business (Företagarguiden) and the company registration service (Foretagsregistrering). 'Verksamt.se' joins up the guidance and information parts with both the <strong>company registration </strong>and<strong> company tax filing eServices</strong>. It furthermore introduces a <strong>new tool</strong> to create a business plan, where information can be transferred and re-used in other eServices.</p><h5>‘<a href="http://www.oppnadata.se/">oppnadata.se</a>‘ Swedish Open Data portal</h5><p>The Swedish portal for accessing open data, created by the Swedish Innovation Agency, Vinnova. </p><h5>'<a href="http://www.openaid.se/en"><em>openaid.se</em></a>' portal</h5><p>The portal '<a href="http://www.openaid.se/en"><em>openaid.se</em></a>' has been created by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to provide information on the aid Sweden gives to other countries.<strong> </strong>The portal will enable organisations, journalists and the public to trace the entire process of giving aid from the preparation of aid efforts through decisions and reports to the evaluation of the tasks undertaken. The immediate goal is to increase transparency on aid, as a way of boosting the fight against poverty. Information from as far back as 1975 is available, even though it becomes more detailed and complete in more recent years. </p><h5>Platform for co-operative use</h5><p><a href="http://www.deladigitalt.se">www.deladigitalt.se</a> is a platform set up by Swedish Association of Local Authorities and Regions (SKL) in order for the public sector to exchange ideas for development, methods and tools. It was launched in 2016 with the purpose to contribute to a more efficient development process in the public sector.</p><p>The platform has rapidly developed and, as of December 2017, it had 5,440 users from 482 different organisations in the public sector. Each week more than new 150 users start using the platform. Today the platform contains more than 450 activities that have been shared. During the course of 2017, 270 attached files have been downloaded 48,000 times for re-use.</p><h1>Networks</h1><h5><a href="https://www.msb.se/sv/Produkter--tjanster/SGSI---Swedish-Government-Secure-Intranet-/">Swedish Government Secure Intranet (SGSI)</a></h5><p>SGSI is an intranet service for secure communication within the country between Swedish Government agencies and among EU Member States and EU bodies via TESTA, the European Community's own private IP-based network for secure information exchange among the European Public Administrations. SGSI is an IP service, a <strong>virtual private network</strong> which has no direct connection with the open Internet. </p><p>According to the <strong>security target</strong> in force, the SGSI may be used by Government agencies which have been accredited. Accreditation implies that <strong>case sensitive information</strong>, which has been classified according to the EU Council’s security regulations as ‘Restreint UE’, can be transferred to TESTA and to connected agencies. SGSI has a wider function than that of TESTA-traffic channel, as it allows for communication between the police and judicial agencies. The network is also expected to become increasingly important for national crisis communication among Swedish Government agencies.</p><h1>eIdentification/eAuthentication</h1><p>The Swedish eIdentification Board, <a href="http://www.elegnamnden.se/">E-legitimationsnämnden</a>, promotes and coordinates electronic identification and signature for the public sector eServices. The Swedish E-identification Board is an authority under the Ministry of Enterprise and Innovation. E-identification in Sweden today is a success story — The Swedish eIdentification Board concludes that the volume of public sector transactions for e-identification and e-signatures increased from 148 million in 2016 to 178 million in 2017. 58% of the municipalities and government authorities provide citizens with e-identification services<sup><a href="#footnote-2" id="footnote-ref-2">[1]</a></sup>.</p><p>In March 2017 the Swedish E-identification Board’s technical framework was updated and adapted to eIDAS. Thanks to the new framework, government authorities and municipalities will be able to connect their eServices to the Swedish eIDAS node, which is being developed by the Swedish E-identification Board.</p><p>Moreover, in October 2017, the Swedish government commissioned the The Swedish E-identification Board to promote increased and widespread use of electronic identification in public sector digital services. The Swedish E-identification Board shall develop measures to support, improve and coordinate the e-identification and e-signature information addressed to users. </p><h5><a href="http://www.polisen.se/Service/Pass-och-id-kort/">‘Official’ electronic ID card</a></h5><p>On 1 October 2005, the Swedish Government introduced the ‘official’ electronic ID card containing <strong>biometric data</strong>. The new ‘national identity card’ (nationellt identitetskort) is not compulsory and does not replace previous paper ID cards. It can be used as a <strong>proof of identity </strong>and<strong> citizenship</strong> and as a valid travel document within the Schengen area. It complies with ICAO standards for biometric travel documents; it is issued by the passport offices and manufactured by the same supplier as the biometric passport. In addition to the <strong>contactless chip</strong> containing a digital picture of the holder, it also has a traditional chip which may be used to securely access eGovernment services in the future. </p><h5><a href="http://www.e-legitimation.se/Elegitimation/Templates/StartPage.aspx">eLegitimation-Non-official eID cards and software-based eIDs</a></h5><p>Swedish citizens have been using non-official electronic ID cards issued by the Swedish Post and software-based electronic IDs like the <a href="http://www.bankid.com/">BankID</a> (developed by the largest Swedish banks) and <a href="http://eid.steria.se/">Steria eID</a> to access certain <strong>eGovernment services</strong>. Any physical person with a Swedish <strong>personal identity number</strong> (a unique identification number for Swedish citizens) can obtain an eID. This number appears on the eID and its microchip.</p><p><strong>Legal entities</strong> can also use an eID. In this case, two types of certificates come into question, namely the <strong>server</strong> and <strong>stamping certificates</strong>, for authentication and signing respectively. The certificates contain the name of the organisation and the organisational number and may also contain a URL. The contact person ordering organisational certificates must have an authorisation for this purpose from a person authorised to sign on behalf of his/her organisation.</p><p>Furthermore, 'Steria' has introduced a new type of eIDs in Sweden; the <strong>organisational certificates </strong>for<strong> personal use</strong>. This type of certificate contains the organisational number, the name of the organisation, as well as the name and the role of the person. It is worth noting that none of the organisational eIDs contain the personal identity number which is considered to be sensitive information.</p><p>As the eIDs are issued by different suppliers, the authority which provides eServices must be able to authenticate users, verify eSignatures and apply for revocation checks in different ways and towards different eID-suppliers. </p><h5>Biometric passports</h5><p>In October 2005, Sweden became the second European country to start issuing biometric passports compliant with the standards recommended by the <a href="http://www.icao.int/Pages/default.aspx">International Civil Aviation Organization</a> (ICAO).</p><p>The ePassport has an <strong>RFID</strong> (Radio Frequency Identification) microchip embedded in its polycarbonate data page containing a digital photo and personal information of the holder.</p><h1>eProcurement</h1><h5>eProcurement Virtual System</h5><p>According to the report '<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/sites/digital-agenda/files/egov_report.pdf">Digitising Public Services in Europe: Putting ambition into action - 9th Benchmark Measurement</a>', produced for the European Commission in December 2010, Sweden set an eProcurement virtual system with a non-mandatory platform where eProcurement services are provided by subcontractors, specialised in the different steps of the electronic procurement process. The central eProcurement authorities’ role consists on monitoring the supplied services and complying with standards. In general, the Swedish Government has not implemented a central electronic public procurement portal, as this is deliberately left up to private operators. Several privately owned and operated portals exist instead, some of which concentrate on public procurement (e.g. <a href="http://www.opic.com/"><em>Opic</em></a> and <a href="http://www.visma.com/"><em>Visma</em></a>).</p><h5>Information on coordinated public sector framework agreements</h5><p>The <a href="http://www.avropa.se/topplankar/In-English/">avropa.se portal</a>, maintained by the National Procurement Services, serves as an <strong>information database</strong> on the different framework agreements which were procured centrally by National Procurement Services. The portal is available to national authorities, Government agencies, regions and municipalities. </p><p>An authority can thus use the information portal to locate the necessary information on a <strong>framework agreement</strong>, whereas the procurement process is further handled by the authority itself, either by electronic, or traditional means.</p><p>General information on public procurement in Sweden is to be found at the <a href="https://www.upphandlingsmyndigheten.se/en">website</a> of the National Agency for Public Procurement.</p><h5>eInvoicing Standard</h5><p>The Swedish National Financial Management Authority leads the work on the procurement of an <strong>eInvoicing infrastructure</strong>, and develops support for agencies. </p><p>The Swedish Government announced in December 2006 that as from July 2008, all public agencies shall process all incoming and outgoing invoices electronically.</p><p>A standard for electronic invoicing in the public sector has been suggested and, on 12 January 2007, regulations were issued, requiring Swedish Government agencies to comply with the <strong>Single Face to Industry</strong> <strong>(</strong><a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/node/133436"><strong>SFTI</strong></a><strong>) </strong>basic invoice specification in their processing of electronic invoices.
