Phase I is currently in progress and will cover the needs of around 1,100 users, which will be served using the current infrastructure. Phase II concerns approximately 7,000 users and will begin with the tender procedures for the procurement of the hardware, software and services required to accommodate the additional load as an extension to the existing infrastructure.</p><p>The eOASIS was awarded the <strong>FileNet EMEAN Innovation Award</strong> in May 2007, followed by the <strong>Cyprus Innovation Prize</strong>, given by the Employers and Industrialists Federation in June 2007.</p><h1>Electronic Payments</h1><p>The Republic of Cyprus has implemented <a href="http://www.cyprus.gov.cy/">electronic payments</a>.
